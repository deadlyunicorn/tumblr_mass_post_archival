## How to use

This is a puppeteer script to make all of your Tumblr posts private.

If you have no experience with Node.js etc. you can easily run this by [installing the bun runtime](https://bun.sh/).

After you download the project on your local machine run inside the directory:

``` 
bun install 
```
After the installation is complete you can execute the script with 
``` 
bun run start 
```

If you face any issues consider installing Chromium.

Things to know: Tumblr doesn't allow you to select more than 100 posts at once.

Possible improvements: We could start selecting posts to archive from the bottom. However I faced some errors during development and I am fine with this version. Feel free to pull request.
